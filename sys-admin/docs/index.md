# TACTIC System Administrator Documentation

TACTIC is an ideal framework for workflow automation development:

- It can be used in diverse server environments including both Windows and UNIX/Linux systems
- It can use a number of database technologies including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLServer and SQLite.
- It can be configured to match your custom asset managements needs
- It is easy to maintain and scale

## Quick Install

To get TACTIC running as quickly as possible, it is best to download the virtual machine and run it under a player such as VMWare Player or VirtualBox.  These virtual machines come preconfigured to just run on your computer.

Instruction on setting this up can be found [here](tsi-setup-and-install)

## Installation

This documentation provides instructions for installing and configuring a TACTIC server for production use.  Due to the dependencies on a number of other systems (such as a database and a webserver), a full installation of TACTIC for production use can be involved.  The documentation below attempts to guide you through the process.

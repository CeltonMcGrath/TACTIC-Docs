#Get TACTIC

You can setup a TACTIC server environment using one of the following packages available from the TACTIC Community [downloads](/community/downloads) page.

1. **TACTIC VM Image** - setup documentation available here. This is the fastest way to try TACTIC. The TACTIC VM is a self-contained server environment that you can host on your own computer using any of a number of virtual machine players (VMWare, VirtualBox, etc)
2. **TACTIC RPM** for Fedora, and CentOS and RHEL - installation documentation available [here](/docs/sys-admin/install-tactic-rhel/).  This will allow you to quickly install an RPM and set up your own environment
3. **TACTIC Enterprise** for Linux and Windows systems - general installation documentation available [here](/docs/sys-admin/install-tactic-general).

To quickly try out TACTIC on your own, you can run TACTIC (either from the RPM install or the Enterprise version) as a standalone.
